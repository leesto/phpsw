PHP South West UK User Group
============================

A simple [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org)-based website for the [PHP South West UK User Group](http://phpsw.org.uk).

Prerequisites
-------------

- PHP >=5.4
- Redis

Setup
-----

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phpsw/phpsw.git
cd phpsw
composer install
npm install
gulp build
app/console redis:restore-fixtures
```

Config
------

If you're forking this for your own meetup, you'll need you set up your own `secrets.yml` to pull in your own content from Meetup & Twitter:

```yaml
# config/secrets.yml
meetup:
    api:
        key: changeme

twitter:
    access_token: changeme
    access_token_secret: changeme

    api:
        key: changeme
        secret: changeme
```

Fixtures
--------

If you want to test against PHPSW event data, you can simply load the fixtures into Redis:

```bash
app/console redis:restore-fixtures
```

Tasks
-----

Almost all of our content is stored in [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/php-sw), but we cache it in Redis to save on API requests, and also pull in tweets from our Twitter account.

If you're forking this project for your own use, you'll need to run these tasks to pull in the content from your own accounts, and you'll probably also want to set them up as cron jobs in production.

```bash
app/console meetup:import:all
app/console twitter:import:all
```

Data
----

Almost all of the data we store in Redis can be considered disposable, the tasks overwrite most of it on each run. This is true of everything except the hash `phpsw:slides`, where Redis is the primary store for this data (Meetup has no concept of talks or slides).

As part of processing the data pulled in, we parse event descriptions based on a common syntax used across PHPSW events in order to derive talks, speakers and associated social profiles for each event (or at least the recent ones), and link in any slides we have stored.

In dev this parsing is done on-the-fly when rendering the page, in production we do it when the `meetup:import:all` task is ran, so that the parsed data is cached in Redis and simply read when serving requests. The `phpsw:speakers` and `phpsw:talks` data that power the speaker pages is only generated in the production `meetup:import:all` run rather than being similarly available on-the-fly in dev, primarily because it would require parsing all events to build a speaker page, fixtures are however provided.
