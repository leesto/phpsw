Here is the task description:\r\n\r\nCreating of a basic cross platform feedback app, with a website backup.\r\nThis is an opportunity for an app developer to showcase their talents,\r\nand add the IT MegaMeet to their client list. Development would be\r\nunpaid. Collecting and processing paper based feedback is a long winded\r\nprocess. Other instant feedback methods tend to lack detail. Most of the\r\npeople at this event have a smart phone, a feedback app could work. The\r\ncreator would retain rights to the code, but it would be nice if it was\r\nopen source, and we could stick an IT MegaMeet logo on it.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you are interested.\r\n\r\n\r\nLyle",
