    "body": "A few of you guys at the last meetup suggested starting a conversation to gauge what sort of topics everyone is interested in hearing about and\/or volunteering to speak about, so here it is!\n\nA couple of thoughts from me:\n\n[b]Testing[\/b]\nI'd be quite interested in hearing about various technologies in use for testing in PHP, I have limited experience outside of PHPUnit and RSpec (in Ruby-land). Would be quite good to hear from anyone with experience with Behat, PHPSpec or other alternatives I haven't heard of.\n\n[b]Scaling[\/b]\nA few of you are scaling stuff way above the majority, ci, multi-server architectures, and the likes, any talks regarding how you do this yourself\/at your organisation I think would go down well, in fact &quot;Scaling Night&quot; is what I contemplating as the meetup for February.\n\nDo please throw your thoughts down if you have any, and if you're interested in talking on anything, do make yourself known!",
