    "body": "\r\nHi All,\r\n\r\nJudging by the event held last year where 200 people attended, it'll be a great networking opportunity.\r\n\r\nWe've now put in place a deadline for free registrations giving us time to organise catering, etc.\r\n\r\nPlease note places are limited. To register - tab, top left on the attached link. One can electronically de-register if you're no longer able to attend.\r\n\r\nThere'll be a UX-related talk and groups giving talks, workshops on computing\/IT related topics that you may find of interest.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/bristol.itmega....\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nIndu\r\n",
