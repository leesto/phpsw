Essentially the event is one big meet up, open to the public. Each group will be doing a presentation on themselves, what they are about, and what they offer the local community. Several groups will be putting on a technical presentation in their chosen area. How-to workshops will be running alongside the main presentations. The event concludes with 5 minute lightning talks on a variety of subjects.\"\r\r\nI'll be talking about PHPSW and giving a technical presentation.\r\r\nWas a really good event last year and it's free!\r\r\nAde",
